# Linguistic Phenomena Tools

This is the repository of the [Linguistic Phenomena Ontology (LiPh)](https://gallosiciliani.unict.it/ns/lpont),
an [Ontolex-lemon](https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ontolex/) extension devoted to represent linguistic phenomena. 

We denote as *linguistic phenomena* those kinds of phenomena which cause modifications 
of language expressions. In addition, we say that such a linguistic phenomenon is 
a *feature* of a specific language if it occurred in the generation of a relevant amount 
of elements of this language.

In addition, the repository contains a LiPh based [ontology 
of features of Gallo-Sicilian varieties](https://gallosiciliani.unict.it/ns/gs-features), i.e. those Gallo-Italic 
varieties spoken in Sicily. 

And, in <code>/examples/nicosia</code>, some example derivations of lexical expression
of the Gallo-Sicilian variety of Nicosia from their Latin etymons.

Finally, a validator to check whether the derivations in a dataset are compliant
with the linguistic phenomena definitions provided in their owns ontology is available as
Java ARchive <code>liphtools-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar</code>.
